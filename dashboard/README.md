# Crimson Widget

One dark red home-screen widget that replaces separate clock, calendar, weather and step widgets.
It matches the [Gothic Crimson theme](../theme/gothic-crimson/README.md).

| Part | Shows | Tap it to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clock | Time, your next alarm and the date | Open the alarm list in Clock, to switch alarms on or off |
| Weather | Temperature, conditions, today's high and low | Open your Weather app |
| Steps | Today's steps with a red progress bar toward your goal | Open Samsung Health |
| Month calendar | This month, with today circled in red and a red dot under days that have events | **‹ ›** change month · month name goes back to this month · a day opens it in your calendar |

## Install

1. On your phone, open this repo's **Releases** page and download `CrimsonWidget.apk` from **Latest builds**.
2. Open the APK and install it. Android asks you to allow installs from your browser the first time.
3. Open **Crimson Widget** and set up:
   - **Weather**: search for your town, or tap **Use my location**. Then tap **Weather tap opens…** and
     pick your weather app (on Samsung phones, **Weather**).
   - **Steps**: tap **Connect steps**, and allow both **Steps** and **Access data in the background**.
     Samsung Health also has to share steps: in Samsung Health, open the menu → **Settings → Health Connect**
     and allow it to write steps.
   - **Calendar**: tap **Allow calendar** to get the event dots. The calendar works without it.
   - **Widget background**: drag the slider to make the background more see-through or more solid.
4. Tap **Add widget to home screen**. It's 6×4 by default, the same space as your current calendar, weather, steps and clock widgets. Long-press it to resize.

## Good to know

- The clock and date update live. Weather and steps refresh every 15 minutes, the most often Android allows.
  Opening the Crimson Widget app also refreshes them.
- Samsung Health sends steps to Health Connect in batches, so the count can be a few minutes behind the Samsung Health app.
- Tapping a gap in the widget does nothing, so a near-miss won't open anything.
- The clock follows your phone's 12- or 24-hour setting, and weeks start on the day your phone's region uses (Monday in the UK).
- Home-screen widgets can't be swiped sideways, because the home screen uses that swipe to change pages. That's why the calendar uses arrows.
- Weather comes from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com), which is free and needs no account.
